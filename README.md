# VDC SDK (node js)
An SDK for Interoute's VDC service.

This SDK can be used with Cloudstack, but was specifically written for Interoute's VDC service, the VDC service is, I believe, no longer actively sold. If you have valid API's keys feel free to test and play with this code, but as I no longer work at Interoute, it is not actively maintained.

```javascript
const VDC = require('./SDK.js')
var vdc = new VDC();
```
